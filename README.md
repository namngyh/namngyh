### 1. Introduction

My work resides at the intersection of **Statistical Theory** and **Software Engineering**. 

With a rigorous academic background in Mathematics and Statistics, I focus on applying quantitative methods to solve complex problems in data science and system optimization. I am particularly interested in the mechanics of virtual economies and the algorithmic foundations of interactive simulations (Game Logic).

My objective is to leverage mathematical models to build robust, data-driven systems that are both efficient and scalable.


### 2. Technical Proficiency

My toolkit focuses on data manipulation, statistical modeling, and database management:

| Domain | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Statistical Computing** | $\textsf{R}$ (Tidyverse, ggplot2, tsibble), $\textsf{Python}$ (Pandas, SciPy, Statsmodels) |
| **Machine Learning** | Scikit-learn, Regression Analysis (OLS, GLM), Hypothesis Testing |
| **Database & Core** | SQL (Data Querying & Normalization), C++ (Data Structures & Algorithms) |
| **Visualization** | Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau |

### 3. Current Focus & Research

* **Applied Statistics:** Exploring time-series analysis and stochastic processes.
* **Game Analytics:** Developing a framework to analyze player retention and game economy balance (Project Phase 2).
* **Algorithms:** Improving computational efficiency using C++.

### 4. Selected Projects

* **Geo Ops Analysis** (Python/SQL): An EDA project analyzing operational metrics. Applied A/B testing methods (T-test/Chi-square) to validate business hypotheses.
* **Econometric Modeling** (R): Implementation of OLS estimators and checking assumptions using Monte Carlo simulations.
